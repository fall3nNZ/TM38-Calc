#Disclaimer
This model is intended for professional engineers, experienced in the design of Concrete structures, or for persons working under  the direct supervision thereof.  Whilst the model is presented in good faith, CCANZ disclaim any and all responsibility for its application in practise.  Neither shall it be liable in anyway for any matters arising from the use of the model by any party.  Updates and/or changes in the model will be communicated to registered users.  However it remains the responsibility of the user to check with CCANZ ( www.cca.org.nz) to ensure they have the latest version.



Background
The background theory for this application is covered in the CCANZ publication " Concrete Ground Floors & Pavements for Commercial & Industrial Use Part 2- Specific Design."  It is recommended that users of this programme read this document which is obtainable form the ConcreteNZ phone Wellington 04 4998820.  An important assumption to note is that the application assumes tensile stresses due to restrained shrinkage are negligible. 


Loads
This application has been designed to accommodate gravity loads which are typically present on industrial floor slabs.  Spread sheets are provided for load layouts comprising of- single rows of warehouse racks, rack which are placed back to back,  and forklift wheel loads.  Other load layouts can be accommodated by manual combination of the stresses associated with individual load points. A Application is provided for single point loads to assist in this.
